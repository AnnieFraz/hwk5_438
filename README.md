##Work Distrubution
Coded the tutorial together.
Half of the team worked on design whilst the other half did the back end 

##Strategey 
We all used Anna's cloud9 workspace and git pushed and pulled with git to work on seperate sections individually

##Problems
We had difficulties with ports
We could not deploy our chat app onto heroku. 

##Improvements
A better grasp of heroku was needed 
Not to use a peer to peer network. 
Use more of the lessons from class
